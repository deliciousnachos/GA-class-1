## ðŸš€ Completion looks like:

You have answered the following questions in your issue ticket:

1. What types of HTML elements are in this page? Which of these are new to you?
2. Find where the stylesheets are linked. There are two of them. `style.css` has all of our styles in it, but what does `reset.css` do? Try taking out `reset.css`. Then try putting `reset.css` above `style.css`.
3. Find the div with class `clearfix` and remove it from the page. What happens? What's in the css in that style rule?
4. How are the images under recent projects included?
5. When does the profile picture show up? How is that managed?
6. Write four questions of your own about the code here.
